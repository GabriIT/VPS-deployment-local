#### Deployment with Nginx, using React as Client and Flask as backend
### Using React as Client to prevent `CORS issues`

### Final Version will be:
1. Client deployed on VPS
2. Server backend local on mu Ubuntu to manage privacy and GPU-required VRAM

#### Server is made with Flask and after containerization runs when the client is notcontainerized

#### Adding Nginx and compose.yaml to run both apps in container 
containers are built successfully and React UI is accessible.
#### However there is no response from backend after inputs in Postman or UI React
